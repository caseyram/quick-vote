### Sequence Editor (SEQE-01, SEQE-02)

| Req | Description | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-----|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| SEQE-01 | Drag handles hidden in live | 26 | DROPPED | Per user decision — editing should remain available during live sessions |
| SEQE-02 | Multi-select rearrangement | 26 | SATISFIED | useMultiSelect hook, group drag in EditorSidebar |

### Results (RESL-01 through RESL-03)

| Req | Description | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-----|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| RESL-01 | Live completion count | 26 | SATISFIED | VoteProgressBar replaces "Results ready" label |
| RESL-02 | Expand multiple reasons | 26 | DROPPED | Per user decision — existing reason review system sufficient |
| RESL-03 | Auto-mark reasons read | 26 | DROPPED | Per user decision — existing viewed tracking sufficient |

**Score: 22/22 active requirements SATISFIED, 3 DROPPED by user decision**

## Dropped Requirements

Three requirements were explicitly dropped during Phase 26 context gathering (documented in 26-CONTEXT.md):

1. **SEQE-01** — Drag handles should remain visible during live sessions (user wants editing to stay available)
2. **RESL-02** — Existing reason review system is sufficient (batch-level reveal + auto-play added in Phase 24.1)
3. **RESL-03** — Existing viewed tracking is sufficient (viewed indicators added in Phase 24.1)

All drops were user-initiated decisions, not implementation failures.

## Unverified Phases

Two phases lack formal VERIFICATION.md files:

### Phase 23: Preview System
- **Evidence:** 23-03-SUMMARY.md documents human verification of AUTH-03, AUTH-04, AUTH-05
- **Risk:** Low — user personally verified all three requirements during plan 23-03 execution
- **Assessment:** Requirements satisfied per human UAT

### Phase 24.1: Presentation-Only Active Mode
- **Evidence:** 24.1-02-SUMMARY.md documents removal of non-presentation active view, addition of split view, reason review system, projection sync
- **Risk:** Low — TypeScript compilation verified, all artifacts confirmed present
- **Assessment:** No specific REQUIREMENTS.md requirements assigned to this phase (improvement phase)

## Known Gaps

### Phase 22: EditorQuestion missing `anonymous` field
- **Severity:** Low (cosmetic/data model)
- **Impact:** `anonymous` is hardcoded to `true` in `toBlueprint()` — no toggle UI exists. All questions are anonymous by default.
- **Status:** TypeScript compiles clean (field is hardcoded, not read from interface). Not blocking any requirement.
- **Recommendation:** Add `anonymous: boolean` to `EditorQuestion` interface and toggle UI if user wants per-question control. Otherwise, current behavior (always anonymous) is acceptable.

## Cross-Phase Integration

Key integration points verified across phase boundaries:

| Integration | From → To | Status |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Template → Session | toBlueprint → Supabase → loadFromBlueprint | Wired |
| Template → Preview | EditorStore → PreviewMode | Wired |
| Session → Presentation | AdminSession → PresentationControls (active view) | Wired |
| Teams → Voting | ParticipantSession → team_id on votes → aggregation | Wired |
| Teams → Results | TeamFilterTabs → aggregateVotes(teamFilter) → projection | Wired |
| Teams → QR | TeamQRGrid → broadcast → PresentationView overlay | Wired |
| Multi-select → Editor | useMultiSelect → EditorSidebar group drag | Wired |
| Vote Progress | PresentationControls → SequenceManager → VoteProgressBar | Wired |
| Broadcast sync | All events (session_active, batch_activated, batch_closed, team_filter_changed, team_qr_toggled, question_selected, reason_highlight, reasons_per_page) | Wired |
| CSV/JSON Export | session-export.ts includes team_id, teams array | Wired |

## Post-Phase Changes (Unplanned)

Several improvements were made after formal phase execution but before this audit:

1. **Lobby view removed** — Merged Start Session + Begin Voting into single "Go Live" action
2. **"Results ready" fix** — Presentation shows "Voting in progress..." during active voting instead of results
3. **CSV export** — Added alongside JSON export on past sessions page
4. **Multi-select relocated** — Moved from SequenceManager (session config) to EditorSidebar (template editor)
5. **Shift-click fix** — Stale closure fix using useRef for multi-select anchor
6. **reasons_enabled default** — Set to true for new sessions

These changes are committed but not part of any formal plan.

## Milestone Verdict

**PASSED** — v1.4 Template Authoring & Teams is complete.

- 22/22 active requirements satisfied across 6 phases
- 3 requirements dropped by explicit user decision (documented)
- 20/20 plans executed
- TypeScript compiles clean
- All cross-phase integrations wired
- 1 low-severity gap (anonymous field) — non-blocking

**Recommendation:** Archive milestone and proceed to v1.5 planning.
