**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-29
**Phases:** 6-10 (plus 09.1 inserted)
**Total Plans:** 18

## Overview

Enable self-paced batch voting mode with on-the-fly batch creation, session management improvements, and results polish.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Batch Schema & UI

**Goal**: Admin can create questions on-the-fly and organize them into named batches within a session
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements**: BATCH-01, BATCH-02
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Database schema & types (batches table, Batch type, store methods)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Batch UI components (BatchCard, BatchList, drag-and-drop with dnd-kit)
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Admin session integration (wire components to Supabase, inline question creation)

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Admin can create a new batch within a session and give it a name
2. Admin can add questions to a batch on-the-fly (create question and assign to batch in one flow)
3. Admin can create multiple batches within the same session
4. Admin can see which questions belong to which batch

### Phase 7: Batch Activation

**Goal**: Admin can activate a batch so participants receive all questions at once for self-paced voting
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: BATCH-03
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Database status column and Zustand activeBatchId state
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Activation UI and handlers (Activate/Close button, mode exclusion, broadcasts)

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Admin can activate a batch from the session admin view
2. When batch is activated, participants receive all batch questions simultaneously (not one-at-a-time push)
3. Admin can see that a batch is currently active

### Phase 8: Participant Batch Experience

**Goal**: Participants can navigate, answer, review, and submit batch questions at their own pace
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: BATCH-04, BATCH-05, BATCH-06, BATCH-07, BATCH-08, BATCH-09, BATCH-10
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Wire batch_activated/batch_closed listeners in ParticipantSession

- [x] 08-04-PLAN.md — Gap closure: Add answer review screen before batch completion

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Participant sees all batch questions and can navigate with Next/Previous buttons
2. Participant sees progress indicator showing current position ("Question 3 of 10")
3. Participant answers persist when navigating between questions (vote saved immediately)
4. Participant can use arrow keys to navigate batch questions on desktop
5. Participant sees visual answer review before final submit showing all their responses
6. Participant can submit/complete the batch when finished answering
7. Participant sees completion animation when answering each question

### Phase 9: Session Management

**Goal**: Admin has a global entry point to manage all sessions with review and export capabilities
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: SESS-01, SESS-02, SESS-03, SESS-04, SESS-05
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — /admin route and session list (search, delete, new session)
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — JSON export library with Zod schemas
- [x] 09-03-PLAN.md — Session review page with batch-grouped results and export wiring
- [x] 09-04-PLAN.md — JSON import library and ImportSessionPanel component
- [x] 09-05-PLAN.md — Wire import panel into AdminSession and verify end-to-end

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Admin can access /admin URL to see list of all sessions
2. Session list is ordered by timestamp with most recent first
3. Admin can reopen a past session to review its results
4. Admin can export a session as JSON with questions grouped by batch and including votes/reasons
5. Admin can import questions from a JSON file that preserves batch groupings

### Phase 09.1: Consolidate Batch and Go Live Experience (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Unify the batch activation and "Go Live" flows so admin can push multiple questions at once
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: GOLIVE-01, GOLIVE-02, GOLIVE-03, GOLIVE-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09.1-01-PLAN.md — Verify batch mode support in vote components
- [x] 09.1-02-PLAN.md — Verify Submit All flow and cleanup

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Admin can type multiple questions and "Add to Batch" before going live
2. Admin clicks "Go Live" to activate entire pending batch at once
3. Participants navigate questions with Next, see "Submit" on final question
4. All votes submitted together at the end (not individually per question)

**Details:**
Urgent insertion to address gap identified in Phase 6 verification: "Go Live" should support batching multiple questions (not single-question push only).

### Phase 10: Progress Dashboard & Results Polish

**Goal**: Admin can monitor batch completion in real-time and results view has improved UX
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: PROG-01, PROG-02, PROG-03, PROG-04, RESL-01, RESL-02, RESL-03, RESL-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Progress dashboard component with real-time vote counts and pulse animation
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — Results polish with read/unread reasons, consistent columns, and keyboard navigation

**Success Criteria (verified):**
1. Admin sees count of participants who have completed the batch
2. Admin sees count of participants still in progress
3. Admin sees per-question response counts
4. Progress dashboard updates in real-time as participants answer
5. Admin can mark individual reasons as read
6. Results columns display in consistent order (agree/disagree positions stable)
7. Results view uses horizontal space efficiently (less vertical scrolling)
8. Admin can navigate between questions using left/right arrow buttons in results view

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 09.1: Consolidate Batch and Go Live Experience (inserted after Phase 9 for urgent fix)

**Key Decisions:**
- dnd-kit for drag-and-drop (modern React 18+ support, accessible)
- Zod for JSON validation (type-safe import/export)
- Batches as runtime feature (not separate collection entity)
- Direct batch submit (review screen removed for faster flow)
- localStorage for read/unread tracking (simple, no database overhead)
- Decimal phase numbering for urgent insertions

**Issues Resolved:**
- Gap identified: "Go Live" needed batch support (addressed in Phase 09.1)
- BatchReviewScreen removed after user feedback (direct submit preferred)
- DndContext isolation fixed for nested drag-and-drop

**Issues Deferred:**
- Collections feature (reusable question sets) deferred to future milestone
- Swipe gesture navigation for mobile deferred

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None - all phase verifications reported clean.
