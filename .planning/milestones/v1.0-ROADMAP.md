# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-28
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 16

## Overview

QuickVote delivers a real-time audience voting application where admins pose questions and participants respond from their phones. The roadmap is structured as five phases: an integration spike to validate the Vercel + Supabase pipeline end-to-end, data foundation and session setup, participant join flow with REST-based voting, realtime infrastructure with live session orchestration, and immersive UI polish with visualization. Each phase produces a demoable checkpoint that builds on the previous.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Integration Spike

**Goal**: The full deployment pipeline is proven end-to-end -- Vite+React app talks to Supabase and is live on Vercel -- before any feature work begins.
**Depends on**: None (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Scaffold Vite+React+TS project with Tailwind and Supabase client setup
- [x] 01-02: Build integration PoC (read/write, Broadcast, Postgres Changes) and deploy to Vercel

**Success Criteria:**
1. Vite + React + TypeScript project scaffolded with Tailwind CSS
2. Supabase project connected -- can read/write from a test table
3. Deployed to Vercel -- live URL works
4. Supabase Realtime subscription works (simple proof-of-concept)
5. Environment variables properly configured in Vercel

### Phase 2: Data Foundation and Session Setup

**Goal**: Admin can create a session, add questions, and get a unique admin link -- the data layer is fully operational and secure.
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (scaffolded project, Supabase connection, deployment pipeline)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Install deps, create DB schema (sessions/questions/votes + RLS), TypeScript types, anonymous auth hook
- [x] 02-02: React Router v7 setup, Zustand store, session creation flow (Home + AdminSession + ParticipantSession pages)
- [x] 02-03: Question CRUD (add/edit/delete/reorder) with QuestionForm and QuestionList components

**Requirements:** SESS-01, SESS-02, SESS-03

---

### Phase 3: Join Flow and Voting Mechanics

**Goal**: Participants can join a session and cast votes that persist correctly -- the complete vote lifecycle works end-to-end without realtime.
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (schema, session/question CRUD)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Install qrcode.react, create utility hooks (useDoubleTap, useHaptic), vote aggregation helper, extend Zustand store with voting state
- [x] 03-02: Build participant voting experience (VoteAgreeDisagree, VoteMultipleChoice, Lobby, ParticipantSession state machine with polling bridge)
- [x] 03-03: Build admin controls (QR code, session state transitions, question activation/close voting, vote progress, SessionResults)

**Requirements:** VOTE-01, VOTE-02, VOTE-03, VOTE-04, JOIN-01, JOIN-02, JOIN-03, JOIN-04

---

### Phase 4: Realtime and Live Session Orchestration

**Goal**: Admin can run a live voting session where participants see questions in real-time, votes update live, and results are revealed on command -- the "magic" that makes this a live polling tool.
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (voting mechanics, join flow, participant identity)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Create useRealtimeChannel, usePresence, useCountdown hooks and extend Zustand store with realtime state
- [x] 04-02: Create BarChart, CountdownTimer, ConnectionBanner, ParticipantCount components and SQL publication file
- [x] 04-03: Rewrite AdminSession and AdminQuestionControl with realtime channel, broadcast, live vote stream, bar chart, timer, presence
- [x] 04-04: Rewrite ParticipantSession with Broadcast listeners, countdown timer, presence, connection banner, remove all polling

**Requirements:** LIVE-01, LIVE-02, LIVE-03, LIVE-04

---

### Phase 5: Immersive UI and Polish

**Goal**: The voting experience feels app-like and tactile -- full-screen, animated, responsive -- transforming a functional tool into QuickVote's core identity.
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (realtime infrastructure, live session flow)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Install motion library, add Tailwind theme tokens, create ConnectionPill component
- [x] 05-02: Refactor vote components (VoteAgreeDisagree, VoteMultipleChoice, VoteConfirmation) with Motion animations
- [x] 05-03: Restyle AdminSession to light theme with projection-friendly BarChart layout
- [x] 05-04: Refactor ParticipantSession with full-screen takeover, slide transitions, ConnectionPill, responsive layout

**Requirements:** UIEX-01, UIEX-02, UIEX-03

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Zustand over React Context for state management (re-render performance with rapid vote updates)
- Single Supabase channel per session multiplexing Broadcast + Presence + Postgres Changes
- Client-side aggregation for v1 (50-100 users); server-side aggregation deferred
- Manual TypeScript types over Supabase-generated types for simplicity
- Admin light theme / Participant dark theme split
- Blue/orange for agree/disagree (neutral, non-judgmental)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Sort stability for voter details (votes reordering while reading aloud)
- Desktop width constraints for reasons display

**Technical Debt:**
- Lobby component defined but inlined in ParticipantSession
- usePresence hook merged into useRealtimeChannel
