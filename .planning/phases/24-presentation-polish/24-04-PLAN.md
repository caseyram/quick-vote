<objective>
Human verification of all PRES requirements to confirm Phase 24 is complete.

Purpose: Visual and functional verification that all presentation polish features work correctly end-to-end. This cannot be automated — transitions, color contrast, and cover images require human visual confirmation.

Output: Verification results confirming all PRES-01 through PRES-06 requirements.

  <name>Task 1: Verify all PRES requirements</name>
  <what-built>
    Phase 24 implemented:
    - PRES-01: Directional slide transitions (right for forward, left for backward) for all sequence items
    - PRES-02: Background color picker in template editor toolbar (wheel + hex input)
    - PRES-03: Auto-contrast text and chart color adaptation
    - PRES-04: Batch cover image selector (existing slides + upload)
    - PRES-05: Cover image displayed on projection during batch voting
    - PRES-06: Navigation buttons always visible in control view
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    **Start dev server:** `npm run dev`

    **PRES-01 — Directional transitions:**
    1. Open template editor, create a template with 3+ slides and a batch
    2. Open Preview mode
    3. Navigate forward — slides should animate in from the right
    4. Navigate backward — slides should animate in from the left
    5. Transitions should be smooth (~400ms) with no gap/flash between items
    6. Verify batches use the SAME transition style as slides (no crossfade)

    **PRES-02 — Background color picker:**
    1. In template editor toolbar, find the "Background" section with a color swatch button
    2. Click the swatch — color picker (wheel + hex input) should appear
    3. Pick a bright color (e.g., white #FFFFFF or yellow #FFFF00)
    4. Verify the preview projection background changes immediately
    5. Click outside the picker — it should close
    6. Save template, reload — background color should persist

    **PRES-03 — Auto-contrast:**
    1. Set background to a light color (#FFFFFF)
    2. In preview, verify text switches to dark color
    3. Set background to dark color (#000000)
    4. Verify text switches to light/white
    5. Check that chart bar colors are visible against both backgrounds

    **PRES-04 — Batch cover images:**
    1. In template editor, expand a batch
    2. Find the "Cover" dropdown in the batch toolbar
    3. Select an existing slide from the dropdown — thumbnail should appear
    4. Alternatively, click "Upload" and upload a new image
    5. Save template, reload — cover image should persist

    **PRES-05 — Cover image on projection:**
    1. Start a live session from a template with a batch that has a cover image
    2. Enter presentation mode and open the projection window
    3. Navigate to the batch — cover image should display full-screen
    4. Reveal results for a question — cover image should fade/transition away and results appear
    5. Verify batches WITHOUT cover images show the existing "Results ready" text

    **PRES-06 — Navigation button layout:**
    1. In presentation mode, navigate to a batch
    2. Verify Previous/Next buttons are fully visible at the bottom
    3. Even with many questions in the batch, nav buttons should not be pushed off-screen
    4. Scroll the batch content — nav buttons stay pinned
