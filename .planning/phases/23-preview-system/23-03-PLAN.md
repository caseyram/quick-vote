  <name>Task 1: Verify complete preview system</name>
  <what-built>
Full session preview system replacing the old Edit/Preview toggle. Opens as a full-page overlay with three synchronized panels: Projection View (crossfade-animated slide/batch content with mock results), Admin Controls (interactive navigation with sequence list), and Participant View (static voting mockup at phone proportions). Keyboard navigation (arrows, Escape) and two entry points (Preview All, Preview from Here).
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Setup:** Open the template editor at `/templates/new` or an existing template. Add at least 2 batches (each with 1+ questions of different types — one agree/disagree, one multiple choice) and 1 slide.

**AUTH-03 — Projection View:**
1. Click "Preview" button in the toolbar
2. Verify the left panel is labeled "Projection View"
3. Navigate to a slide → verify it shows the slide image (light theme, not dark)
4. Navigate to a batch → verify it shows the batch name, question text, and a bar chart with mock vote results
5. Navigate between items → verify crossfade animation on projection panel

**AUTH-04 — Admin Controls:**
1. Verify the center panel is labeled "Admin Controls"
2. Verify it shows Previous/Next buttons and position indicator
3. Click Next → verify ALL three panels advance simultaneously
4. Click Previous → verify all three panels go back
5. Click a specific item in the sequence list → verify all three panels jump to it
6. Verify current item is highlighted in the sequence list
7. Verify mock session info shows at the bottom ("12 participants connected", "Session: Active")

**AUTH-05 — Participant View:**
1. Verify the right panel is labeled "Participant View"
2. Navigate to a slide → verify participant panel shows "Waiting for presenter" message
3. Navigate to a batch with agree/disagree question → verify voting buttons appear with one pre-selected
4. Navigate to a batch with multiple choice question → verify option buttons appear with one pre-selected
5. Verify participant view renders at phone-like proportions (narrow, centered within panel)
6. Verify "Your vote has been recorded" confirmation text appears

**Preview Navigation:**
7. Press Escape → verify overlay closes and returns to editor
8. Open preview again with arrow keys → verify left/right arrows navigate between items
9. Select a specific item in the sidebar, then use "Preview from Here" → verify preview starts at that item
10. Use "Preview All" → verify preview starts at the first item

**General:**
11. Verify the old Edit/Preview SegmentedControl toggle is gone from the toolbar
12. Verify the editor always shows sidebar + main area (no more mode switching)
13. Verify all content uses light theme (no dark backgrounds in any panel)
